# User Stories

As a User navigating on to Ready to Play Games, I would be greeted with 
a splash page with the logo in the top left and a rotating display of characters. 
Under these sprites Would be a bar with some text containing the mission statement.
Beneath that is a grid of three rows showing various options for campaigns.
Under that would be information about the dev and some links.

I create a user by selecting the user icon in the top right. Filling in 
a username, first name, last name, an email, a password, a profile pic and a bio. Upon successful
creation I am routed to make a screen to make my first character. As I'm feeling impatient,
I press the "randomize all" button and then "create a character" to make a completely random
character. The character slides to the bottom right into a pouch as the screen is navigated
to a new page.

This page shows a collection of campaign templates arranged by environment category. Each card
shows the name of the campaign, the general length, recommended character level (avg of the npc levels),
and a picture of the environment. After adding a few interesting campaigns to my favorites, I select the
card that looks interesting to me and the rest of the cards slide off the screen and my card goes to the 
center of the screen. Some options appear to the right of the card asking the number of people joining,
the level of the characters, the visibility of the lobby, and the name of the lobby. After filling this 
out, I am navigated to a page where the starting environment is shown.

This environment shows the lobby name and has spots for the number of people I wanted to join. There is 
also a bit of text beneath the name and some obscured text that on click will show the lobby key needed to 
join. Since my lobby was private, this key is needed for anyone to join. I send this code to my friends and 
they join my lobby by clicking on the "Join Lobby" header in the navbar. We play the game and have a great time!

The next day we want to play again so I click the "Create Lobby" and am navigated to my list of running 
campaigns and underneath is my favorited templates. Beneath those are random templates.
